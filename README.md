# About me
I am a second year master’s student in the health and medical program at the Journalism department. I have a bachelor’s degree in English, and spent the summer reporting on health and science topics for the Dallas Morning News. 

Goals for MADA
I am hoping to learn how to perform data analyses in this course that I can leverage in my reporting career. Data journalism is increasingly critical, and I hope to enrich my reporting and make myself more marketable through this course. 

Experience
I took a library science course in undergrad where we learned R (but this was in 2017 and I never used it again), and I used SPSS last year, which I believe has some R similarities. I am not confident in my coding abilities at all, but I am hoping that will change after this course. 

Personal facts
I have two demanding and precious kitties, Ocho and Ellen. Ocho is thusly named because he was thrown out of a car when he was a kitten, so he’s down to only eight of his nine lives. I enjoy running and yoga.
