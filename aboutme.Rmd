**About Me**

I am a second year master’s student in the health and medical program at the Journalism department. I have a bachelor’s degree in English, and spent the summer reporting on health and science topics for the Dallas Morning News.

**Goals for MADA**

I am hoping to learn how to perform data analyses in this course that I can leverage in my reporting career. Data journalism is increasingly critical, and I hope to enrich my reporting and make myself more marketable through this course. 

**Experience**

I took a library science course in undergrad where we learned R (but this was in 2017 and I never used it again), and I used SPSS last year, which I believe has some R similarities. I am not confident in my coding abilities at all, but I am hoping that will change after this course. 

**Personal Facts**

I have two demanding and precious kitties, Ocho and Ellen. Ocho is thusly named because he was thrown out of a car when he was a kitten, so he’s down to only eight of his nine lives. I enjoy running and yoga.

This interactive article reports the varied pricing for different insurances for the same medical procedure at the same hospital. Sometimes the cheapest option is actually the no insurance at all option. There are multiple cool charts that show the prices for a specific procedure across different areas in the US with different types of insurance. This is the type of data journalism that inspired me to take this class!
